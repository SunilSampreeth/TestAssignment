JDK 
- Java Development Kit
- JDK is a software which contains all the resources in 
order to develop and execute java programs.
JRE 
- Java Runtime Environment
- JRE is a software which provides a platform for 
executing java programs.
JIT Compiler
- Just In Time Compiler
- JIT Compiler complies/coverts java program(High Level) 
into machine understandable language.
Class Loader
- Loads the Class from secondary storage to executable 
area.
Interpreter
- Interprets the code line by line.
JVM 
- Java Virtual Machine
- JVM is the Manager of the JRE.

JVM Architecture
1. Heap Area - Objects get created here.
2. Class Area - or Static Pool - All the static members 
gets stored here.
3. Stack - Execution happens inside stack.
4. Method Area - Implementation of methods is stored here.
5. Native Area

1.We develop a java program and save the file 
with the extension (.java).
2. Next, we compile a java program to check if 
there are any error in the program or not.
3. If the compilation is unsuccessful (program 
has errors) then we need to Debug.

4. If the compilation is successful, the byte 
code (intermediate code) gets generated with
the extension (.class).
5. Once the Byte code is generated, we can 
execute (interpret) the program on all 
operating systems.
6. WORA stands for Write Once Run Anywhere.
